# 25.5.2 View Processing Algorithms

> The optional `ALGORITHM` clause for `CREATE VIEW` or `ALTER VIEW` is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It affects how MySQL processes the view. `ALGORITHM` takes three values: `MERGE`, `TEMPTABLE`, or `UNDEFINED`.

CREATE VIEW 或 ALTER VIEW 的可选 ALGORITHM 子句是 MySQL 对标准 SQL 的扩展。它影响了 MySQL 如何处理视图。接受如下三个参数：

> For `MERGE`, the text of a statement that refers to the view and the view definition are merged such that parts of the view definition replace corresponding parts of the statement.

- MERGE：合并引用视图和视图定义的语句的文本，以便视图定义的部分替换语句的相应部分。

> For `TEMPTABLE`, the results from the view are retrieved into a temporary table, which then is used to execute the statement.

- TEMPTABLE：将视图的结果放到临时表中，然后该表用来执行语句。

> For `UNDEFINED`, MySQL chooses which algorithm to use. It prefers `MERGE` over `TEMPTABLE` if possible, because `MERGE` is usually more efficient and because a view cannot be updatable if a temporary table is used.

- UNDEFINED：MySQL选择使用哪个算法。如果可能的话，更倾向于 MERGE，因为 MERGE 通常更高效，因为如果使用临时表的话，视图不能被更新。

> If no `ALGORITHM` clause is present, the default algorithm is determined by the value of the [`derived_merge`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/switchable-optimizations.html#optflag_derived-merge) flag of the [`optimizer_switch`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system variable. For additional discussion, see [Section 8.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/derived-table-optimization.html).

如果没有 ALGORITHM 子句，默认算法由 optimizer_switch 系统变量的 derived_merge 标志的值决定。

> A reason to specify `TEMPTABLE` explicitly is that locks can be released on underlying tables after the temporary table has been created and before it is used to finish processing the statement. This might result in quicker lock release than the `MERGE` algorithm so that other clients that use the view are not blocked as long.

显式指定 TEMPTABLE 的一个原因是，可以在创建临时表之后，和在使用临时表完成语句处理之前释放底层表上的锁。

这可能会导致比 MERGE 算法更快的锁释放，这样其他使用视图的客户端就不会阻塞那么长时间。

> A view algorithm can be `UNDEFINED` for three reasons:

将视图算法定义为 UNDEFINED 的三个理由：

> No `ALGORITHM` clause is present in the `CREATE VIEW` statement.

- 在 CREATE VIEW 语句中，没有 ALGORITHM 子句。

> The `CREATE VIEW` statement has an explicit `ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED` clause.

- CREATE VIEW 语句有明确的 ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED 子句。

> `ALGORITHM = MERGE` is specified for a view that can be processed only with a temporary table. In this case, MySQL generates a warning and sets the algorithm to `UNDEFINED`.

- 为只能使用临时表来处理的视图指定 ALGORITHM = MERGE。在这种情况下，MySQL 生成一个警告，设置算法为 UNDEFINED。

> As mentioned earlier, `MERGE` is handled by merging corresponding parts of a view definition into the statement that refers to the view. The following examples briefly illustrate how the `MERGE` algorithm works. The examples assume that there is a view `v_merge` that has this definition:

如前所述，**MERGE 是通过将视图定义的相应部分合并到引用该视图的语句中来处理的**。

下面的例子简单地说明了 MERGE 算法是如何工作的。这些例子假设有一个视图 v_merge 有以下定义:

```sql
CREATE ALGORITHM = MERGE VIEW v_merge (vc1, vc2) AS
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;
```

> Example 1: Suppose that we issue this statement:

示例1：

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_merge;
```

MySQL handles the statement as follows:

- v_merge becomes t

- `*` becomes vc1, vc2, which corresponds to c1, c2

- The view WHERE clause is added

The resulting statement to be executed becomes:

结果待执行语句成为：

```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;
```

> Example 2: Suppose that we issue this statement:

示例2：

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_merge WHERE vc1 < 100;
```

> This statement is handled similarly to the previous one, except that `vc1 < 100` becomes `c1 < 100` and the view `WHERE` clause is added to the statement `WHERE` clause using an `AND` connective (and parentheses are added to make sure the parts of the clause are executed with correct precedence). The resulting statement to be executed becomes:

这条语句处理类似于上面那条，除了 vc1 < 100 成为了 c1 < 100，且 WHERE 子句使用了 AND 连接。结果待执行语句成为：

```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE (c3 > 100) AND (c1 < 100);
```

> Effectively, the statement to be executed has a `WHERE` clause of this form:

实际上，要执行的语句有一个这种形式的 WHERE 子句:

```sql
WHERE (select WHERE) AND (view WHERE)
```

> If the `MERGE` algorithm cannot be used, a temporary table must be used instead. Constructs that prevent merging are the same as those that prevent merging in derived tables and common table expressions. Examples are `SELECT DISTINCT` or `LIMIT` in the subquery. For details, see [Section 8.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/derived-table-optimization.html).

如果不能使用 MERGE 算法，必须使用临时表。

防止合并的构造与在派生表和公共表表达式中防止合并的构造相同。例如子查询中的 SELECT DISTINCT 或 LIMIT。
