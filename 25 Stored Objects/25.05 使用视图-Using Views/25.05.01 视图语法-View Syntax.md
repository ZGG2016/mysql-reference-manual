# 25.5.1 View Syntax

> The `CREATE VIEW ` statement creates a new view (see [Section 13.1.23, “CREATE VIEW Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-view.html)). To alter the definition of a view or drop a view, use `ALTER VIEW` (see [Section 13.1.11, “ALTER VIEW Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-view.html)), or `DROP VIEW` (see [Section 13.1.35, “DROP VIEW Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-view.html)).

CREATE VIEW 语句创建一个新的视图。

ALTER VIEW 语句修改一个视图。

DROP VIEW 语句删除一个视图。

> A view can be created from many kinds of [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements. It can refer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, [`UNION`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html), and subqueries. The `SELECT` need not even refer to any tables. The following example defines a view that selects two columns from another table, as well as an expression calculated from those columns:

视图也可以从 SELECT 语句中创建。它可以引用基础表或其他视图。它可以使用 joins、union 和子查询。SELECT 甚至不需要引用任何表。

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50), (5, 60);
mysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;
mysql> SELECT * FROM v;
+------+-------+-------+
| qty  | price | value |
+------+-------+-------+
|    3 |    50 |   150 |
|    5 |    60 |   300 |
+------+-------+-------+
mysql> SELECT * FROM v WHERE qty = 5;
+------+-------+-------+
| qty  | price | value |
+------+-------+-------+
|    5 |    60 |   300 |
+------+-------+-------+
```
