> MySQL supports stored routines (procedures and functions). A stored routine is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing the individual statements but can refer to the stored routine instead.

MySQL 支持存储例程(过程和函数)。**存储例程是一组可以存储在服务器上的 SQL 语句**。一旦完成了这一步，客户端就无需不断地重新发出单个语句，而是可以引用存储例程。

> Stored routines can be particularly useful in certain situations:

存储例程在某些情况下特别有用:

> When multiple client applications are written in different languages or work on different platforms, but need to perform the same database operations.

- **当多个客户端应用程序使用不同的语言编写，或工作在不同的平台上，但需要执行相同的数据库操作**。

> When security is paramount. Banks, for example, use stored procedures and functions for all common operations. This provides a consistent and secure environment, and routines can ensure that each operation is properly logged. In such a setup, applications and users would have no access to the database tables directly, but can only execute specific stored routines.

- **当安全性是至高无上的时候**。例如，银行对所有常见操作使用存储过程和函数。这提供了一致和安全的环境，例程可以确保正确地记录每个操作。在这种设置中，**应用程序和用户不能直接访问数据库表，而只能执行特定的存储例程**。

> Stored routines can provide improved performance because less information needs to be sent between the server and the client. The tradeoff is that this does increase the load on the database server because more of the work is done on the server side and less is done on the client (application) side. Consider this if many client machines (such as Web servers) are serviced by only one or a few database servers.

**存储例程可以提供更好的性能**，因为服务器和客户端之间需要发送的信息更少了。折衷的是，这确实**增加了数据库服务器上的负载**，因为更多的工作在服务器端完成，而更少的工作在客户端(应用程序)端完成。如果许多客户端机器(如Web服务器)只由一个或几个数据库服务器提供服务，请考虑这一点。

> Stored routines also enable you to have libraries of functions in the database server. This is a feature shared by modern application languages that enable such design internally (for example, by using classes). Using these client application language features is beneficial for the programmer even outside the scope of database use.

存储例程还**使你能够在数据库服务器中拥有函数库**。这是现代应用程序语言共享的一个特性，可以在内部支持这样的设计(例如，通过使用类)。使用这些客户端应用程序语言特性对程序员是有益的，即使在数据库使用范围之外也是如此。

> MySQL follows the SQL:2003 syntax for stored routines, which is also used by IBM's DB2. All syntax described here is supported and any limitations and extensions are documented where appropriate.

MySQL 的存储例程遵循 SQL:2003 语法，IBM 的 DB2 也使用该语法。这里描述的所有语法都受到支持，任何限制和扩展在适当的地方都有文档记录。
