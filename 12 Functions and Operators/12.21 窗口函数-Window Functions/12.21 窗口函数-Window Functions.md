The following sections discuss how to use window functions, including descriptions of the OVER and WINDOW clauses. The first section provides descriptions of the nonaggregate window functions. For descriptions of the aggregate window functions, see [Section 12.20.1, “Aggregate Function Descriptions”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html).
