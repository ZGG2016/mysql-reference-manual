# 12.21.04 Named Windows

*Windows can be defined and given names by which to refer to them in OVER clauses. To do this, use a WINDOW clause. If present in a query, the WINDOW clause falls between the positions of the HAVING and ORDER BY clauses, and has this syntax:*

可以定义窗口，并在 OVER 子句中通过一个名字来引用它们。为此，使用 WINDOW 子句。如果在查询中出现，WINDOW 子句位于 HAVING 和 ORDER BY 子句的位置之间。

语法如下：

WINDOW window_name AS (window_spec)
    [, window_name AS (window_spec)] ...

*For each window definition, window_name is the window name, and window_spec is the same type of window specification as given between the parentheses of an OVER clause, as described in [Section 12.21.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/window-functions-usage.html):*

对每个窗口定义，window_name 是窗口名称，window_spec 与 OVER 子句的圆括号中给出的窗口规范类型相同。

	window_spec:
	    [window_name] [partition_clause] [order_clause] [frame_clause]

*A WINDOW clause is useful for queries in which multiple OVER clauses would otherwise define the same window. Instead, you can define the window once, give it a name, and refer to the name in the OVER clauses. Consider this query, which defines the same window multiple times:*

WINDOW 子句在多个 OVER 子句的查询中非常有用。

```sql
SELECT
  val,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'row_number',
  RANK()       OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'rank',
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'dense_rank'
FROM numbers;
```

*The query can be written more simply by using WINDOW to define the window once and referring to the window by name in the OVER clauses:*

```sql
SELECT
  val,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS 'row_number',
  RANK()       OVER w AS 'rank',
  DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS 'dense_rank'
FROM numbers
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY val);
```

命名窗口还可以更容易地试验窗口定义，以查看对查询结果的影响。你只需要在 WINDOW 子句中修改，而不是在多个 OVER 子句中修改。

*A named window also makes it easier to experiment with the window definition to see the effect on query results. You need only modify the window definition in the WINDOW clause, rather than multiple OVER clause definitions.*

*If an OVER clause uses OVER (window_name ...) rather than OVER window_name, the named window can be modified by the addition of other clauses. For example, this query defines a window that includes partitioning, and uses ORDER BY in the OVER clauses to modify the window in different ways:*

如果一个 OVER 子句使用 `OVER (window_name ...)`，而不是 `OVER window_name`，那么命名了的窗口会被其他子句修改。如下例：

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT year, country,
  FIRST_VALUE(year) OVER (w ORDER BY year ASC) AS first,
  FIRST_VALUE(year) OVER (w ORDER BY year DESC) AS last
FROM sales
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country);
```

*An OVER clause can only add properties to a named window, not modify them. If the named window definition includes a partitioning, ordering, or framing property, the OVER clause that refers to the window name cannot also include the same kind of property or an error occurs:*

一个 OVERE 子句仅可以为一个命名了的窗口添加属性，而不是修改它们。如果命名了的窗口定义包含分区、排序或框架属性，则引用窗口名称的 OVER 子句不能包含相同类型的属性，否则会发生错误。

- This construct is permitted because the window definition and the referring OVER clause do not contain the same kind of properties:

	OVER (w ORDER BY country)
	... WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country)

- This construct is not permitted because the OVER clause specifies PARTITION BY for a named window that already has PARTITION BY:

	OVER (w PARTITION BY year)
	... WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country)

*The definition of a named window can itself begin with a window_name. In such cases, forward and backward references are permitted, but not cycles:*

命名窗口的定义本身可以以 window_name 开头。在这种情况下，允许向前和向后引用，但不允许循环:

- This is permitted; it contains forward and backward references but no cycles:

	WINDOW w1 AS (w2), w2 AS (), w3 AS (w1)

- This is not permitted because it contains a cycle:

	WINDOW w1 AS (w2), w2 AS (w3), w3 AS (w1)
