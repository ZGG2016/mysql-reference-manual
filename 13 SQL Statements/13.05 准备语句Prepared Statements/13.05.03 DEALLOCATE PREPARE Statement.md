# 13.05.03 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement

[TOC]

	{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name

> To deallocate a prepared statement produced with PREPARE, use a DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement that refers to the prepared statement name. Attempting to execute a prepared statement after deallocating it results in an error. If too many prepared statements are created and not deallocated by either the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement or the end of the session, you might encounter the upper limit enforced by the max_prepared_stmt_count system variable.

若要释放由 PREPARE 生成的准备语句，请使用引用准备语句名称的 DEALLOCATE PREPARE 语句。

在释放一个准备语句后，试图执行它会导致一个错误。如果创建了太多的准备语句，并且在 DEALLOCATE PREPARE 语句或会话结束时没有解除分配，你可能会遇到由 max_prepared_stmt_count 系统变量强制的上限。
