> This section describes the syntax for the BEGIN ... END compound statement and other statements that can be used in the body of stored programs: Stored procedures and functions, triggers, and events. These objects are defined in terms of SQL code that is stored on the server for later invocation (see [Chapter 25, Stored Objects](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-objects.html)).

本节介绍 `BEGIN ... END` 复合语句和其他可用于存储程序体的语句:存储过程和函数、触发器和事件。这些对象定义在 SQL 代码中，存储在服务器上，以便稍后调用。
