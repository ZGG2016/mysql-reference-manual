# 13.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement

```sql
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS]
    view_name [, view_name] ...
    [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```

> `DROP VIEW` removes one or more views. You must have the `DROP` privilege for each view.

DROP VIEW 移除一个或多个视图。

必须要有每个视图的 DROP 权限。 

> If any views named in the argument list do not exist, the statement fails with an error indicating by name which nonexisting views it was unable to drop, and no changes are made.

如果参数列表中的任意视图不存在，则语句将失败，并出现一个错误，该错误通过名称指示它无法删除那些不存在的视图，并且不会进行任何更改。

> Note: In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, `DROP VIEW` returns an error if any views named in the argument list do not exist, but also drops all views in the list that do exist. Due to the change in behavior in MySQL 8.0, a partially completed `DROP VIEW` operation on a MySQL 5.7 replication source server fails when replicated on a MySQL 8.0 replica. To avoid this failure scenario, use `IF EXISTS` syntax in `DROP VIEW` statements to prevent an error from occurring for views that do not exist. For more information, see [Section 13.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/atomic-ddl.html).

> The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error from occurring for views that don't exist. When this clause is given, a NOTE is generated for each nonexistent view. See [Section 13.7.7.42, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-warnings.html).

IF EXISTS 会阻止产生由于视图不存在而导致的错误。

> `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE`, if given, are parsed and ignored.

如果给出 RESTRICT 和 CASCADE，则解析并忽略它们。
